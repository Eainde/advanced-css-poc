## CSS value processing: What you need to know
   - Each CSS property has initial value, used if nothing is declared
   - Browers specify a root font size for each page (usually 16px).
   - Percentages and relative values are always converted to pixels.
   - Percentages are measured relative to their parents font-size, if used to specify font-size.
   - Percentages are measured relative to their parents's width, if used to specify lengths.
   - em are measured relative to their parent font-size, if used to specify font-size
   - em are measured relative to the current font-size, if used to specify lengths.
   - rem are always measured relative to the document's root  font size.
   - vh and vw are simply percentage measurements of the viewport's height and width.
